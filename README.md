## About The Project

[![Edgebox Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://edgebox.co)

Edgebox is an easy to configure and use system. It brings powerful features that go alongside or can even completely replace various services that you already use in the day-to-day.


### Built With

* [Go Lang](https://golang.org/)
* [SH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)
* [Lots of Love <3](https://edgebox.co/team)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

If you're installing this to run natively in the system, you better be doing it inside of the [Development Virtual Machine](https://github.com/edgebox-iot/devm). This software can do destructive action in the system is is running. You've been warned.

If you're running for development purposes, a Docker container suffices, so make sure you have:
* Docker
* Docker Compose
```sh
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose
```

Check the following links for more info on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Aditionally, edgeboxctl needs the following bash commands available wherever it runs:
* `arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc` (`sudo apt-get install gcc-arm*`)
* `sh`
* `rm`
* `systemctl`
* `lsblk`
* `yq`
* `tinc-boot` _(not mandatory)_
